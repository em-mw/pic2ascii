if you want your image to look good you should keep your image around 300-400px after conversion (width)

Ex: 1920x1080  scale_factor= 0.18  final_image: 345x194 (width is in between the range)


tips(you probobly know already):
you can find the scale factor by dividing the number between 300 and 400 and the width of your image
you can multiply the scale factor by the width to get the final width number
