what to do next?:

make cpu processes area work
disable and enable all buttons in the stathide/statshow function at command (do some reasearch for non buggy way of doing that)
make and map all the top actions (file, help, about)
link the start and stop buttons
link the progress bar to the status of all of the pic2ascii processing engines
add more allowed input and output file types
support for unicode characters
add a way of showing an error message if user selected unsupported file type
add more user control settings (monchome color/colour image filter, ext.) *may need to add another tab (probably something called: advanced)

this is just a list on what to work on beffore releasing the final relese.
